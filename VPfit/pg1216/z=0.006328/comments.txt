OI:
	Good fit. Fitted with 2 comp. large b value for comp II b~50 km/s.

CII : 
	Good fit. Fitted with 2 comp. Unknown contamination on left.

SiII:
	Good fit. Fitted with 2 comp. Used SiII 1526, 1260 and 1190 to fit.
	Used only SiII 1260 to fit the first component, as it's not much prominent in others.
	SiII 1193 contaminated from galactic NI 1199 and 1200 lines so excluded from fit
	SiII 1304 contaminated from geocoronal Lya emission.

HI:
	Average fit. Fitted with 4 comp, redshift of two comp fixed from CII fit and one from SiII fit. Contaminated with OVI 1038 (self-identified) from z=0.179960, and hint of OVI 1032 is also there at the same redshift.
	However, left wing still couldn't be fitted.
