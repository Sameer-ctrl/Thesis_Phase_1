SiIII:
	Good fit

CIII:
	Good fit

OVI:
	Excluded OVI 1038 from fit, looks little noisy. and I component comes to be quite (b~58 km/s) broad

HI:
	Ly6 contaminated with galactic SiII, so excluded from fit. All the rest transitions are used to fit the lines. Tried excluding Ly16 and Ly17 from fit, but got same parameters.
