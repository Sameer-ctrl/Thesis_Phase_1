NV:
	Weak line

NII:
	Shows a little asymmetric right wing, but couldn't fit 2 components

PII:
	Very weak line

SiIII:
	Good fit

SiIV:
	Very narrow line. So error are overestimated.
	Errors from chi-sq : b - 0.4     logN - 0.04

OVI:
	Good fit

CIV:
	Little noisy CIV_1550
	Currently both lines are fitted together

CII:
	Best what we can get for both the lines, though visually not good.
	Fitting one doesn't fit other.

HI:
	Not sure how many components to fit. Linelist gives two components for Lya but one 	for Lyb. Savage et. al fitted 3 components. Currently fitted with 2 components, but 	none are BLA. Fitting 3 components do gives a large b(~80) for one component but gives low b (~10) for one component also. Other Lyman transitions are not in COS coverage, but Savage et al. used those to fit.

SiII:
	 
	 SiII1260 clearly shows two components while other line shows a little hint of two components, Currently fitted with two components.
