NV:
	Weak line

NII:
	Shows a little asymmetric right wing, but couldn't fit 2 components

PII:
	Very weak line

SiIII:
	Good fit

SiIV:
	Very narrow line. So error are overestimated.
	Errors from chi-sq : b - 0.4     logN - 0.04

OVI:
	Good fit

CIV:
	Little noisy CIV_1550
	Currently both lines are fitted together

CII:
	Best what we can get for both the lines, though visually not good.
	Fitting one doesn't fit other.
