SiIII:
	Good fit. Little broad b ~ 33 km/s

NV:
	Good fit. Very narrow line b~1 km/s. So very large errors. Errors got from freezing the parameters. NV 1242 is non detection.

CIV: 
	Nice fit. A little hint of two component, but couldn't fit 2. Currently fitted with 1.

HI:
	Nice fit. Contaminated from NV 1242 from z=0.020021. Saturated, other transitions are mot covered in COS. Fitted with two components.
