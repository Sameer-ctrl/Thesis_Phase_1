SiIII:
	Nice fit, Earlier fitted with 2 comp but now fitted with two comp.

CIII:
	Nice fit, Earlier fitted with 2 comp but now fitted with two comp.

CII:
	Nice fit, Earlier fitted with 2 comp but now fitted with two comp.

SiIV:
	Good fit. Line not much prominent though. SiIV 1402 is non-detection.

SiII:
	Satisfactory fit. Fitted 2 components because right wings seem to be little 	asymmetrical. Used all the 3 lines for fitting

OVI:
	Satisfactory fit. Line is not much strong though. Used both lines to fit. Earlier 	fitted with 1 comp, but looked little asymmetric so fitted with 2 comp, the b values 	are small b~ 10 and 3, and error are large for both b and col den.

HI:
	All the lines are nearly saturated and other lines are outside COS coverage. 	Currently fiited with two components.
