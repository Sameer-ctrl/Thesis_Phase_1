HI:
	Good fit

SiIII:
	Fitted with two components now, though second component is very weak. Always ambiguous on number of components for weak lines.

NV:
	

OVI:
	OVI 1038 is strongly contaminated by ISM LyÎ± absorption and geocoronal emission (savage et al. 2014)
	Couldn't fit OVI 1032
