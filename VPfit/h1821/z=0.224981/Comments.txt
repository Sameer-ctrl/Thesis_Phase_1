SiIII:
	good fit

CIII:
	Nice fit

OVI:
	Good fit, but 2nd component has low b value of ~1km/s.

HI:
	HI 930 has low S/N so excluded from fitting. Fitting it with parameters got from other lines don't give good fit.
	Absorption on both sides of HI 972 is from ISM Si II 1190 and Si II 1193 lines 
	Fitted with 5 components also based on Savage et al. but none are bla, max b is 37. using params from Savage et al. fits Lyman alpha and beta but not others.
	And Lyman alpha and HI 930 are shifted to fit.
