SiIII:
	good fit, earlier fitted with 1 comp, now fitted with 2 comp.

CIII:
	Nice fit, earlier fitted with 2 comp in one profile, which is now fitted with 3 comp

OVI:
	Good fit, but 2nd component has low b value of ~3km/s. Has 1 distant comp also.

HI:
	HI 930 has low S/N so excluded from fitting. Fitting it with parameters got from other lines don't give good fit.
	Absorption on both sides of HI 972 is from ISM Si II 1190 and Si II 1193 lines, excluded from fit. 
	Used Lya, Lyb, Lyd and HI 937 for fitting. Earlier fitted with 3 comp, now fitted with 5 comp.
