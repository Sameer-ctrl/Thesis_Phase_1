HI:
	Good fit

SiIII:
	Fitted with two components now, though second component is very weak. Always ambiguous on number of components for weak lines.

NV:
	Good fit. Fitted with 2 comp. NV 1242 is contaminated with galactic NiII 1454. 

OVI:
	Not much good, should be cautious, differ from Savage, but this was the best possible.
	OVI 1038 is strongly contaminated by ISM LyÎ± absorption and geocoronal emission (savage et al. 2014)
	Fitted with 2 comp, one is very broad b~150, contaminated with HI 930 from z=0.296630 and 0.296845, and galactic SiIII 1206 lines.
