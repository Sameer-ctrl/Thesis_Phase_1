CIV:
	Good fit. Component I in CIV 1550 is not much prominent. Tried fitting only CIV 1548 alone, but parameters don't change much.
	Fitted both lines together

SiIII:
	Good fit 

SiIV:
	Good fit. SiIV 1403 is contaminated with galactic FeII 1608 lines. Used both lines for fitting.

OVI:
	Nice fit. OVI 1038 is contaminated with galactic SiII 1190 line

HI:	
	Nice fit. Lya is contaminated with galactic SiIV 1394 line.
