AlII:
	Good fit. Fitted with 2 comp. Danforth has given just one comp, clearly a two comp structure is there, could not find any other possible contamination, sofitted two comp.

OI: 
	Good fit. Fitted with 2 comp. Same issue of 1 comp vs 2 comp as for AlII

FeII:
	Good fit. FeII 1608 is contaminated from NV 1242 (self identified) from z=0.316648. Fe II 1144 also seems to be contaminated from some unknown contamination.

SiIV:
	Good fit. Fitted with 3 comp. Third component is very broad b~120 km/s.

CIV:
	Good fit. Fitted with 4 comp. Lot of substructure, maybe even further is possible. CIV 1550 is contaminated with Lya from z=0.299318.

SiII:
	Good fit. Fitted with 2 comp. SiII 1260 is fitted with 3 comp, third comp is not there in other lines. 
	SiII 1193 is contaminated from geocornal Lya emission so excluded from fit.
	SiII 1260 is contaminated from Lya from z=0.054086

SiIII:
	Average fit. Fitted with 2 comp, one comp is very broad b~130 km/s.

NV:
	Average fit : Highly contaminated
	NV 1238 contaminated with galactic SiII 1260 lines (2 comp) and galactic SII 1259.
	NV 1242 contaminated with Lyb from z=0.233056 and Lya from z=0.040917.

CII:
	Average fit. Contaminated with OI from z=0.043138. 
	CII* 1335 doublet is also there from z=0.017241. Currently saved as 2nd comp of the line.

HI:
	Good fit .Fitted with 5 comp. Comp IV col density has large error ~ 0.98 dex, comp II is very broad b~115 km/s
