CIII:
	Good fit

OIII: 
	Good fit, but a little less chi-sq of 0.68

OVI:
	Good fit. Currently fitted with one component. OVI 1032 has something on the right wing. Fitting two components give a good fit for 1032, but not for 1038, could be subjected to continuum.

HI : 
	HI 1025 : contamination from Lya from z=0.198659
	HI 972 :  contamination from Lyb from z=0.346781,0.347695,0.347918
	HI 930 :  contamination from Lyb from z=0.290181
	HI 926 :  contamination from Lya from z=0.082976, CIII 977 from z=0.347946
	HI 937 badly contaminated from galactic CII, CIII from z=0.365110 so excluded from fit, HI 923 was also excluded due to low S/N
