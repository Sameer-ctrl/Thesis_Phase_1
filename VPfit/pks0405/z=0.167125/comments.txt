OVI :
	OVI 1038 seems to be contaminated from Lya at z=0, so only OVI 1032 has been 	fitted.
	Shows a hint a 5th component blueward of 1st component. But fitted with 4 	components as of now.

CII :
	CII 1036 seems to be contaminated, so only CII 1334 has been fitted.

CIII : 
	Great fit

OI:
	Very shallow

NII:
	two very nearby components

NIII:
	maybe a little contamination on the wings

NV:
	contamination from Lyb from z=0.408816

SiIII:
	great fit!

SiIV:
	Low SNR 1st component
	Should consider more uncertainity in logN of this component

SiII:
	SiII 1526 has low S/N, so dropped from fitting
	Has other nearby lines, didn't fit now, but could be fitted.

HI:
	Lyg contaminated with galactic (ISM) NI 1134
	Same problem as always with HI, some show some components, some show other 	components
