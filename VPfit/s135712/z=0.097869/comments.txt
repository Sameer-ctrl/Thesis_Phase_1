SiIII:
	Good fit. 
	Large error in col density of component II due to low b. Error using chi-sq is 0.13

CIV:
	Good fit, a little noisy though.

SiIV:
	Satisfactory fit. Used both SiIV 1393 and 1402 to fit. SiIV 1402 is not much strong.

CII:
	Used only CII 1334 line to fit. As CII 1036 is noisy and not much strong so excluded.

OVI:
	OVI 1032 is out of coverage of COS. So only have OVI 1038, which is not much great. Fitted one component only, fitting two components doesn't give satisafactory fit.

HI:
	Good fit. Only have Lya and which is saturated also. All other transitions are outside COS coverage. Fitted nearby components also. Contaminated with galactic CII* 1335 line. Fixed the redshift of component 2 and 3 to that of SiIV.
