OI :
	Good fit. Has Lyg on left and NIII 989 on right, currently not fitted. 

SiIII:
	Nice fit. large erros in col density and b  of component II due to low b value. Error in col density is estimated by fixing all other parameters and varying it alone. Getting similar error with chi-sq also.

CII:
	Nice fit. Contaminated with OVI 1032 from z=0.468475 on left and with Lye from z=0.617596 on right. Fitted with both single and 2 components.

CIII:
	Nice fit. Contaminated with Lya from z=0.175257 on left. Fitted with both one component and 3 components with redshifts fixed from HI as line is saturated. Fitting two components also give similar fit.

NIII:
	Good fit

SiII:
	Satisfactory fit. SiII 1193 has something on right wing, couldn't identify.

OVI:
	Satisfactory fit. Not much good S/N . Seems like can be fitted with two components, but as OVI 1038 is much weak, couldn't decide. Currently fitted with one.

HI:
	Lyman limit system.
	Fitted using line from HI 937 to 918 with HI 920 excluded. earlier fitted with two components, but Lya to Lyd fits were not good, so fitted with 3 components, now the fits are good.
	Lyb contaminated with Lya from z=0.233778
	HI 930 contaminated with OVI 1032 from z=0.320172
	HI 920 contaminated with unknown contamination (possibly from Ly12 from z=0.469115)
	HI 915 (Ly14) contaminated with Lya from z=0.102172
