	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Quantitative estimates of the basic properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), such as its density and metallicity, depend on the spectrum of incident UV background radiation. Models of UV background are known to have large variations, mainly because they are synthesized using poorly constrained parameters, which introduce uncertainty in the inferred properties of the CGM. Here, we quantify this uncertainty using a large set of new UV background models with physically motivated toy models of metal-enriched CGM. We find that the inferred density and metallicity of low-density (10−5 cm−3) gas is uncertain by factors of 6.3 and 3.2, whereas high-density (10−3 cm−3) gas by factors of 4 and 1.6, respectively. The variation in the shape of the UV background models is entirely responsible for such a variation in the metallicity, while variation in the density arises from both normalization and shape of the UV background. Moreover, we find a harder (softer) UV background infers higher (lower) density and metallicity. We also study warm-hot gas at T = 105.5 K and find that metallicity is robustly estimated but the inferred density is uncertain by a factor of 3 to 5.4 for low to high-density gas. Such large uncertainties in density and metallicity may severely limit the studies of the CGM and demand better observational constraints on the input parameters used in synthesizing UV background.},

DR17 contains the complete release of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, which reached its goal of surveying over 10,000 nearby galaxies. The complete release of the MaNGA Stellar Library accompanies this data, providing observations of almost 30,000 stars through the MaNGA instrument during bright time. DR17 also contains the complete release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 survey that publicly releases infrared spectra of over 650,000 stars. The main sample from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), as well as the subsurvey Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey data were fully released in DR16. New single-fiber optical spectroscopy released in DR17 is from the SPectroscipic IDentification of ERosita Survey subsurvey and the eBOSS-RM program. Along with the primary data sets, DR17 includes 25 new or updated value-added catalogs. This paper concludes the release of SDSS-IV survey data. SDSS continues into its fifth phase with observations already underway for the Milky Way Mapper, Local Volume Mapper, and Black Hole Mapper surveys.},

	abstract = {We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r{\textless}=17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses μ50{\textless}=24.5 mag arcsec-2. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small ({\textasciitilde}0.1\%), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99\%, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N{\textgreater}4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9\%) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s-1). About 6\% of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55" minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.},

Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5

title = {BROAD H i ABSORBERS AS METALLICITY-INDEPENDENT TRACERS OF THE WARM-HOT INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM*},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Thermally broadened Lyα absorbers (BLAs) offer an alternative method to highly ionized metal lines for tracing the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) at T&gt;105 K. However, observing BLAs requires data of high quality and accurate continuum definition to detect the low-contrast features, and a good knowledge of the velocity structure to differentiate multiple blended components from a single broad line. Even for well-characterized absorption profiles, disentangling the thermal line width from the various thermal and non-thermal contributors to the observed line width is ambiguous. We compile a catalog of reliable BLA candidates along seven active galactic nucleus sight lines from a larger set of Lyα absorbers observed by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We compare our measurements based on independent reduction and analysis of the data to those published by other research groups. We examine the detailed structure of each absorber and determine a reliable line width and column density. Purported BLAs are grouped into probable (15), possible (48), and non-BLA (56) categories. Combining the first two categories, we infer a line frequency , comparable to observed O vi absorbers, also thought to trace the WHIM. We discuss the overlap between BLA and O vi absorbers (20%–40%) and the distribution of BLAs in relation to nearby galaxies (O vi detections in BLAs are found closer to galaxies than O vi nondetections). We assume that the line width determined through a multi-line curve of growth (COG) is a close approximation to the thermal line width. Based on 164 measured COG H i line measurements, we statistically correct the observed line widths via a Monte Carlo simulation. Gas temperature and neutral fraction  are inferred from these statistically corrected line widths and lead to a distribution of total hydrogen columns. Summing the total column density over the total observed path length, we find a BLA contribution to the closure density of ΩBLA = 6.3+1.1−0.8 × 10−3 h−170 based on 104 Monte Carlo simulations of each BLA system. There are a number of critical systematic assumptions implicit in this calculation, and we discuss how each affects our results and those of previously published work. In particular, the most comparable previous study by Lehner et al. gave ΩBLA = 3.6 × 10−3 h−170 or 9.1 × 10−3 h−170, depending on which assumptions were made about hydrogen neutral fraction. Taking our value, current O vi and BLA surveys can account for ∼ 20% of the baryons in the local universe while an additional ∼ 29% can be accounted for in the photoionized Lyα forest; about half of all baryons in the low-z universe are found in the intergalactic medium. Finally, we present new, high signal-to-noise ratio observations of several of the BLA candidate lines from Early Release Observations made by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on HST.}

	abstract = {We describe the 2017 release of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. A major development since the previous release has been exporting the atomic data into external data files. This greatly simplifies updates and maintenance of the data. Many large datasets have been incorporated with the result that we can now predict well over an order of magnitude more emission lines when all databases are fully used. The use of such large datasets is not realistic for most calculations due to the time and memory needs, and we describe the limited subset of data we use by default. Despite the fact that we now predict significantly more lines than the previous Cloudy release, this version is faster because of optimization of memory access patterns and other tuning. The size and use of the databases can easily be adjusted in the command-line interface. We give examples of the accuracy limits using small models, and the performance requirements of large complete models. We summarize several advances in the H- and He-like iso-electronic sequences. We use our complete collisional-radiative models of the ionization of these one and two-electron ions to establish the highest density for which the coronal or interstellar medium (ISM) approximation works, and the lowest density where Saha or local thermodynamic equilibrium can be assumed. The coronal approximation fails at surprisingly low densities for collisional ionization equilibrium but is valid to higher densities for photoionized gas clouds. Many other improvements to the physics have been made and are described. These include the treatment of isotropic continuum sources such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the reported output, and the ability to follow the evolution of cooling non-equilibrium clouds.},

title = {Hot Gas in Galaxy Halos Traced by Coronal Broad Lyα Absorbers},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We explore the possibility to systematically study the extended, hot gaseous halos of low-redshift galaxies with coronal broad Lyα absorbers (CBLAs). These are weak, thermally broadenend H i absorption lines arising from the tiny fraction of neutral hydrogen that resides in the collisionally ionized, million-degree halo gas in these galaxies. Using a semi-analytic approach, we model the spatial density and temperature distribution of hot coronal gas to predict strength, spectral shape, and cross section of CBLAs as a function of galaxy-halo mass and line-of-sight impact parameter. For virial halo masses in the range log , the characteristic logarithmic CBLA H i column densities and Doppler parameters are log N(H i) = 12.4–13.4 and b(H i) = 70–200 km s−1, indicating that CBLAs represent weak, shallow spectral features that are difficult to detect. Yet, the expected number density of CBLAs per unit redshift in the above given mass range is (CBLA) ≈ 3, implying that CBLAs have a substantial absorption cross section. We compare the model predictions with a combined set of UV absorption-line spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and HST/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph that trace the halos of four low-redshift galaxies. We demonstrate that CBLAs might already have been detected in these spectra, but the complex multi-component structure and the limited signal-to-noise ratio complicate the interpretation of these CBLA candidate systems. Our study suggests that CBLAs represent a very interesting absorber class that potentially will allow us to further explore the hot coronae of galaxies with UV spectral data.}

In the low-z IGM, we have accounted for ~40% of the baryons: 30% in the photoionized Lyα forest and 10% in the (T = 105–106) WHIM traced by O VI. Statistical metallicities are consistent with the canonical value of 10% solar, with considerable scatter. Improved statistics for weak absorbers allows us to estimate ΩWHIM/Ωb = 0.073 ± 0.008 down to  log NO VI = 13.4 and 0.086 ± 0.008 down to  log NO VI = 13.0. The O VI absorber line frequency,  d  /dz = 40−8+14, down to 10 mÅ equivalent width suggests a 250-300 kpc extent of metals around dwarf galaxies. Many absorbers appear to contain multiphase gas, with both collisional ionization and photoionization determining the ionization state. N V absorption is well correlated with O VI, and both ions show similarly steep power-law indices  d  /dz  ∝ N−β with  βO VI ≈ βN V ≈ 2  while  βH I. We conclude that O VI and N V are reliable tracers of the portion of the WHIM at T ≈ 105–106 K. C IV may be present in both collisional and photoionized phases;  NC IV  correlates poorly with both  NH I and  NO VI  and  βH I &lt; βC IV &lt; βO VI. The ions C III, Si III, and Si IV are well correlated with H I and show patterns typical of photoionization. Adjacent ion stages of the same element (C III/IV and Si III/IV) provide useful constraints on the photoionization parameter, log U ≈ − 1.5 ± 0.5.}

abstract = {Using high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of 16 low-z QSOs obtained with the E140M echelle mode of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, we study the physical conditions and statistics of O VI absorption in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z &lt; 0.5. We identify 51 intervening (zabs≪ zQSO) O VI systems comprising 77 individual components, and we find 14 “proximate” systems (zabs ≈ zQSO) containing 34 components. For intervening systems (components) with rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 30 mÅ, the number of O VI absorbers per unit redshift dN/dz = 15.6−2.4+2.9 (21.0−2.8+3.2) , and this decreases to dN/dz = 0.9−0.5+1.0 (0.3−0.3+0.7)  for Wr &gt; 300 mÅ. The number per redshift increases steeply as zabs approaches zQSO; we find that dN/dz is ≈3-10 times higher within 2500 km s−1 of zQSO. The most striking difference between intervening and proximate systems is that some proximate absorbers have substantially lower H I/O VI ratios. The lower ratios in proximate systems could be partially due to ionization effects, but these proximate absorbers must also have significantly higher metallicities. We find that 37% of the intervening O VI absorbers have velocity centroids that are well aligned with corresponding H I absorption. If the O VI and the H I trace the same gas, the relatively small differences in line widths imply that the absorbers are cool, with T &lt; 105 K. Most of these well-aligned absorbers have the characteristics of metal-enriched photoionized gas. However, the O VI in the apparently simple and cold systems could be associated with a hot phase with T ≈ 105.5 K if the metallicity is high enough to cause the associated broad Lyα absorption to be too weak to detect. We show that 53% of the intervening O VI systems are complex multiphase absorbers that can accommodate both lower metallicity collisionally ionized gas with T &gt; 105 K and cold photoionzed gas.}
