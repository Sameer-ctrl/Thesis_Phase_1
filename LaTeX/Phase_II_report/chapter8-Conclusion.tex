\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work} \label{ch:conclusions}

% So far we have completed the preliminary Voigt profile fitting of the 16 absorption systems with \ion{O}{vi} absorption. So our next task is to model the ionisation conditions in these 16 absorbers. We will model each of the absorbers component wise and try to find the ionisation state of these absorber systems. Then we will complete the survey by extending the work to other 12 remaining systems. We will also explore the galaxy environments of these absorbers to deduce their origins. We will then use results from these 28 absorber systems to the complete set of 568 identified BLA candidates to estimate the contribution of BLAs to the $\Omega_b$.
